# AR-Ruler

AR-Ruler project is an iOS application that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to measure the length of real-world objects. The application is built using Swift and utilizes the ARKit framework and allows users to measure the length of real-world objects using their mobile devices. ARKit is a powerful framework that enables developers to create augmented reality experiences on iOS devices. It provides a suite of tools and technologies that allow developers to build 3D scenes, track the user's position and orientation, and overlay virtual objects onto the real world. 

The AR-Ruler project uses ARKit's object tracking and surface detection features to ensure that the virtual ruler aligns accurately with the real-world object being measured. SceneKit, a 3D graphics engine that allows developers to create sophisticated 3D models and animations is used. SceneKit provides a high-level API for building 3D scenes and includes features such as physics simulation and lighting effects. The AR-Ruler project uses SceneKit to render the virtual ruler and to provide visual feedback to the user.

One of the challenges of building an AR application is ensuring that the virtual objects align accurately with the real world. To solve this problem, the AR-Ruler uses a combination of object tracking and surface detection. Object tracking enables the app to recognize and track real-world objects, while surface detection allows the app to detect the position and orientation of flat surfaces such as tables and floors.
